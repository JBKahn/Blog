I'm a software developer currently working a 16 months as a co-op at [Wave](https://waveapps.com) through the PEY program at the University of Toronto. I'm working towards developing my skills in several areas and will use this blog to document my journey into the world of software development.

## In this blog I'll talk about:

* Tech books I'm reading.
* Projects I'm working on at work, that I'm allowed to discuss.
* Projects I'm working on outside of work.
* Things I learn during development.
* Anything else I do relating to the world of tech.
